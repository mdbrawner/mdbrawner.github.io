## Academic and Research Interests
***
My research interests lie in the fields of historical ecology, global change ecology and macroecology.  I am particularly interested in the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to rapid environmental changes over historical time periods.  I am currently pursuing a PhD in Ecology at Oregon State University.  My dissertation research uses a variety of techniques to explore temporal changes in the body sizes of endothermic species across large spatial and temporal scales in relation to climate, niche dynamics and population trends.

## Research Experience
***
###### 2015<br>Field Assistant, American Museum of Natural History Field Station, Portal, AZ <br>Supervisor: McKenna Kelly.
Worked with PhD student McKenna Kelly on a study of the hormonal mechanisms behind cooperative breeding behavior in Mexican jays in SE Arizona.  This work involved color banding, resighting, capturing, handling, and blood drawing of both Mexican jays and Western scrub-jays.  Also performed experimental cognitive test with feeding trials to determine birds ability to discriminate quantities.

###### 2013 – 2015<br>Lab Assistant, Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University <br>Supervisor: Dr. Rebecca Terry
Raptor pellet dissection and species identification of small mammal remains. Prepared hair, bone, and plant samples for stable isotope analysis in collaboration with David Taylor’s PhD work.  Developing a website for a project designed to engage citizen scientists and elementary school educators in helping to map the distribution of small mammal species in Oregon using raptor pellets

###### 2014<br>Field and Lab Assistant, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University<br>Supervisor: Allyson Jackson
Worked with PhD student Allyson Jackson studying mercury contamination in riparian songbird communities in the Willamette Valley.  Used target mist-netting to capture, band, and take blood and feather samples from breeding songbirds along the Willamette River corridor. Collected emergent aquatic insects which were identified to family and prepared for mercury analysis.

###### 2014<br>Lab Assistant, Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University<br>Supervisor: Paul Bradley
Worked with PhD student Paul Bradley studying chytrid fungus dynamics in Western Oregon frogs and tadpoles.  Used DNA extraction and qPCR techniques to quantify results

###### 2013<br>Field Assistant, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University<br>Supervisor: Dr. Jim Rivers
Participated in field study of habituation response to a novel object in breeding tree and violet-green swallows.  Recorded behavioral data, time to entry, number of feeding bouts, and nestling measurements.  Assisted in capture, banding and blood sampling in adult swallows.

###### 2012 – 2013<br>Lab Assistant, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University<br>Supervisor: Dr. Douglas Robinson
Data entry of historical bird survey data set into eBird format.


## Volunteer Experience

Created and hosted a two-day exhibit for 1st through 5th grade children highlighting the diversity of bird bills and their adaptations to diet.  Concepts of adaptation and evolution were addressed using preserved museum specimens and an activity where students got to try their hand at catching different types of “prey” with simulated bird bills.

###### Aug 2016
KidSpirit Camp Special Presentation, Corvallis, OR<br>
Organization: Oregon State University<br>
Assisted Professor Rebecca Terry with an activity for primary-school aged children that focused on dinosaur biology, fossils, and the preparation of fossil specimens.
