## Academic and Research Interests
***
My research interests lie in the fields of historical ecology, global change ecology and macroecology.  I am particularly interested in the ecological and evolutionary responses of organisms to rapid environmental changes over historical time periods.  I am currently pursuing a PhD in Ecology at Oregon State University.  My dissertation research uses a variety of techniques to explore temporal changes in the body sizes of endothermic species across large spatial and temporal scales in relation to climate, niche dynamics and population trends.

## Research Experience
***
### 2015
#### Field Assistant, American Museum of Natural History Field Station, Portal, AZ
Supervisor: McKenna Kelly.<br>
Worked with PhD student McKenna Kelly on a study of the hormonal mechanisms behind cooperative breeding behavior in Mexican jays in SE Arizona.  This work involved color banding, resighting, capturing, handling, and blood drawing of both Mexican jays and Western scrub-jays.  Also performed experimental cognitive test with feeding trials to determine birds ability to discriminate quantities.

### 2013 – 2015
#### Lab Assistant, Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University
Supervisor: Dr. Rebecca Terry<br>
Raptor pellet dissection and species identification of small mammal remains. Prepared hair, bone, and plant samples for stable isotope analysis in collaboration with David Taylor’s PhD work.  Developing a website for a project designed to engage citizen scientists and elementary school educators in helping to map the distribution of small mammal species in Oregon using raptor pellets

### 2014
#### Field and Lab Assistant, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University
Supervisor: Allyson Jackson<br>
Worked with PhD student Allyson Jackson studying mercury contamination in riparian songbird communities in the Willamette Valley.  Used target mist-netting to capture, band, and take blood and feather samples from breeding songbirds along the Willamette River corridor. Collected emergent aquatic insects which were identified to family and prepared for mercury analysis.

### 2014
#### Lab Assistant, Department of Integrative Biology, Oregon State University
Supervisor: Paul Bradley<br>
Worked with PhD student Paul Bradley studying chytrid fungus dynamics in Western Oregon frogs and tadpoles.  Used DNA extraction and qPCR techniques to quantify results

### 2013
#### Field Assistant, Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University
Supervisor: Dr. Jim Rivers<br>
Participated in field study of habituation response to a novel object in breeding tree and violet-green swallows.  Recorded behavioral data, time to entry, number of feeding bouts, and nestling measurements.  Assisted in capture, banding and blood sampling in adult swallows.

### 2012 – 2013
#### Lab Assistant, Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, Oregon State University
Supervisor: Dr. Douglas Robinson<br>
Data entry of historical bird survey data set into eBird format.


## Volunteer Experience
***
### May & Oct 2017
#### Discovery Days, Corvallis, OR
Organization:<a href="https://www.science.oregonstate.edu/"> Oregon State University College of Science</a><br>
Created and hosted a two-day exhibit for 1st through 5th grade children highlighting the diversity of bird bills and their adaptations to diet.  Concepts of adaptation and evolution were addressed using preserved museum specimens and an activity where students got to try their hand at catching different types of “prey” with simulated bird bills.<br>
<blockquote cite = "https://cosey.oregonstate.edu/discovery-days"><i>
"Discovery Days encourages students to develop their own questions and ideas regarding the sciences while creating a deeper interest to learn more."</i></blockquote>

### Aug 2016
#### KidSpirit Camp Special Presentation, Corvallis, OR
Organization: <a href="https://www.oregonstate.edu/">Oregon State University</a><br>
Assisted Professor Rebecca Terry with an activity for primary-school aged children that focused on dinosaur biology, fossils, and the preparation of fossil specimens.<br>
<blockquote cite = "https://kidspirit.oregonstate.edu/mission"><i>
"KidSpirit strives to serve as a leader in providing young people with intentional, high quality, equitable learning experiences that promote positive interactions among adults and peers."</i></blockquote>

### 2013 – 2017
#### Raptor Surveys
Organization: <a href="https://www.ecaudubon.org/">East Cascades Audubon Society</a><br>
Conducted bi-monthly raptor surveys along 50 mile routes in Benton County, OR from November to February.<br>
<blockquote cite = "https://www.ecaudubon.org/winter-raptor-survey"><i>
"The Winter Raptor Survey [WRS] project, established in the winter of 2004-05, is designed to determine wintering populations of the various species of birds of prey throughout the state of Oregon, and parts of California, Idaho and Washington. Through a collection of preapproved survey routes, volunteers completing the once a month surveys from December through February will count the various species that they find and report their findings to the project coordinator."</i></blockquote>

### 2012 – 2013
#### Wildlife Rehabilitation, Corvallis, OR
Organization: <a href="https://www.chintiminiwildlife.org">Chinitmini Wildlife Center</a><br>
Weekly volunteer at the wildlife recovery center.  Responsibilities included admissions, cleaning and maintaining cages, preparing diets, administering foods and medications to young or weak animals, and following proper procedure for capture and handling of animals.<br>
<blockquote cite = "https://www.chintiminiwildlife.org/"><i>
"Chintimini provides care for injured and orphaned wildlife, with the goal of returning them to their natural habitat and fosters a connection between people and wildlife through education."</i></blockquote>


### 2011 – 2012
#### Amphibian Egg Mass Monitoring, Portland, OR
Organization: <a href="https://www.oregonmetro.gov">Portland Metro</a><br>
Conducted amphibian egg mass surveys in Winter/Spring breeding season as part of Portland Metro’s Natural Areas Restoration Program.<br>
<blockquote cite = "https://www.oregonmetro.gov/how-metro-works/volunteer-opportunities/amphibian-survey"><i>
"Amphibians serve as indicator species, which can be used to help gauge whether regional restoration efforts are helping more native amphibians thrive. Surveying for the egg masses each winter helps scientists survey their numbers as well as the overall health of wetlands in the region. The information collected from volunteers also helps secure grant funding for future restoration work."</i></blockquote>
